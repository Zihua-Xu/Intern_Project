# Intern_Project
The project's name is RF motion recognition with CV-assisted learning. This project explored using RF signals for human activity recognition to detect and track human movements without visual monitoring.
## Data Collection
Two parts of data are collected. The first part is RF signal data, which is in the form of Doppler-time Plot. It can detect subtle movements and characterize the unique motion signatures of the micro-scale movements of moving people. The second part is the data used for CV models to identify the actions performed which requires the use of camera.
